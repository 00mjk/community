## Objective

Creation of a new TensorFlow module and namespace (`tf.types`) dedicated to storing implementation-free type definitions. This module has no other dependencies inside TensorFlow, so any other module can depend on it to ensure interoperability without the risk of creating circular dependencies.

## Motivation

**Interoperability and composability**. A set of stand types that formalize an interface and decouples it from implementation ensures composability between components, especially when multiple implementations are involved.

**Supports the [acyclic dependencies principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acyclic_dependencies_principle)**. In many instances, circular dependencies are caused between low-level complex components that need to compose (e.g. autograph needs to recognize datasets, and datasets need to use autograph). Interface extraction is a common pattern for breaking such cycles.

**Supports pytype**. A set of static types that is consistent under Pythonâ€™s isinstance/issubclass is required to support pytype in TensorFlow. This module can serve as the basis for that.

**Helps formalize requirements for new APIs**. Having a formal, implementation-independent definition for things such as tensors, variables, iterables, iterators makes it easy to document and test compatibility between APIs.

## User Benefit

Application developers may use these canonical definitions for pytype annotations.

Library developers can more easily define their API interfaces by referring to this namespace.

Developers of modules internal to TensorFlow can use this module to avoid creating circular dependencies.

## Design Proposal

### The `tf.types` namespace / module
All the declarations exposed under the `tf.types` namespace reside in the `python/types/*.py` module. These are [abstract base classes](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/abc.html) with a bare minimum of method definitions and minimal or no implementation, which serve to formalize and document the contract of common types such as `Tensor`, `Variable`, etc.

These definitions may be used as [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) type hints, although in some cases they may be type-erased (for example, `tf.types.Tensor` may not necessarily be parametrized by `dtype` or `shape`).

The type definitions are also consistent with `isinstance` and `issubclass` checks. So for example `isinstance(tf.Tensor, tf.types.Tensor) == True`.

### General principles
The `tf.types` module may depend on external packages (such as `numpy`) strictly for the purpose of defining type annotations and documentation. No dependencies to other TensorFlow interfaces are allowed. Any dependencies on external packages which themselves depend on TensorFlow are expressly forbidden.

Changes definitions inside `tf.types` must be approved by TensorFlow leads, and typically should be accompanied by an RFC.

All type declarations are compatible with [pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype).

It is recommended that internal and external type annotations, `isinstance` and `issubclass` checks use these types, eventually deprecating helpers like `tf.is_tensor`. However, concrete types continue to exist - for example, variables are still created using `tf.Variable`, which is now a subclass of `tf.types.Variable`.

### Support for `tf.function`'s `input_signature`
The type system listed here can be expanded to allow input signatures using type annotations, see for instance [this thread](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/31579).

### Initial type hierarchy
The list is extensible, any types included in the list are subject to normal backward compatibility rules, which means they are unlikely to change in the future. It is therefore preferable to maintain a strict minimum of orthogonal declarations and carefully vet any additions.

* Core types

  * `DType`
  * `Shape`
  * `Tensor` - generic dense tensor

    * `Symbol` - the regular graph tensor
    * `Value` - eager tensors

  * `Variable`

* Container types

  * `Composite` - low-level static structure
  * `Module` - builder for structures of Variables
  * `Optional`
  * `List` - superclass for `TensorArray`

* Higher-level types
  * `Dataset`
  * `Iterator`
  * `Iterable`
  * `Function`
  * `Error`

 * Distributed types
   * `DistributedDataset`
   * `DistributedIterator`

### Alternatives Considered
* N/A

### Performance Implications
* No performance implications expected. At most, we are adding a small number of levels to the class tree of some objects.

### Dependencies
* None, by definition.

### Engineering Impact
* Engineering impact: Separate interfaces allow for faster loading times by reducing coupling between modules.
* Maintenance: Minimal maintenance overhead since there is no functionality involved. The TensorFlow team and contributors will maintain the documentation up to date. Changes should be reviewed and approved by the TensorFlow team leads.

### Platforms and Environments
* Platforms: Python only, in the first stage. However, the type system should be aligned as much as possible with the core types in the TensorFlow runtime, and be language-independent as much as possible.
* Execution environments: The type system is independent of platform. This also implies that no platform-specific types (such as `TPUTensor`) exist.

### Best Practices
* This set of type definitions support the acyclic dependencies principle, by requiring that implementations avoid lateral dependencies (e.g. with a linter rule).

### Tutorials and Examples
* N/A

### Compatibility
* Minor version requirement. Existing classes (tf.Tensor) will become subclasses of the new type interfaces.
* Most subcomponents of TF (Lite, distributed, function, SavedModel) will depend on this new module, although their functionality is not impacted.
* Libraries which depend on TensorFlow are encouraged to refer to `tf.types` definitions, rather than the concrete implementations for better future compatibility.

### User Impact
* Users will see a new `tf.types` module, that may be referenced from documentation and type annotations.
